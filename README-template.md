## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learnt how to access child elements of a CSS selector,also how to use custom fonts

Here are some samples of my code:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lexend+Deca&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Big+Shoulders+Display:wght@700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

```css
.card:nth-of-type(1) > button {
  color: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I would like to refine my layout shifting skills.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/css/button+edges+rounded+css) - This helped me for making rounded edges on buttons. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
